        <br>
            Ever since my graduation on May 2021 I took it upon myself to learn the standard web technologies
            as well as modern frameworks that allow me to render my websites more responsive, dynamic, and faster
            in order to create a better UI/UX. It took me only <strong> five months </strong> to learn the fundamentals
            of HTML5, CSS and JavaScript as well as their corresponding frameworks.

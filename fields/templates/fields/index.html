           My name is Pablo Loo Quintero and I am a First Generation American and college student.
           I was born in the United States but I have lived my entire life in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico.
           </br> </br>
           My first studies in the U.S. were in Simon Rivera High School in Brownsville, TX, where
           I had to take the public bus and cross the International border every day in order to go to school. 
           I then graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Biomedical Engineering from Texas A&M University.
           Ever since graduation I have been working towards becoming a great Software Engineer.
           </br> </br>
           My ultimate goal is to become a Software Engineer proficient in the areas of  
           Web Development, Game Development, Cybersecurity and Machine Learning.
